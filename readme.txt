      NOTES:
------------------
Please note that CoD4 Mod Tools requires your video drivers and DirectX to be up to date. For certain applications to work correctly a DX9 video card is required, even though the game itself will run on a DX8 video card. Please contact your hardware manufacturer to find the latest drivers for your system.

The CoD4 Mod Tools do not work in Windows Vista, although some users have reported some success running them in Windows XP Compatibility Mode.

CoD4 Mod Tools require that your Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare installation has been updated to version 1.4. Patches are available at http://www.infinityward.com/modernwarfare/patch

Currently, Cod4 Mod tools are only supported for the English version of the game. Other languages will be supported soon.

The CoD4 Mod Tools require a DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0 compliant card and the .NET Framework Version 2.0 or higher, available from Windows Update or http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&displaylang=en

------------------
  INSTALLATION:
------------------
To install, unzip the files to your Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare directory. This is where you installed the game to. The default location is "C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare".

Once unzipped you will want to make shortcuts to the following applications:
[gamepath]\bin\CoD4CompileTools\CoD4CompileTools.exe
[gamepath]\bin\MoDBuilder.exe

These are the only two applications that you should have shortcuts to, or run directly from explorer. The other exe files not listed above are not intended to be ran directly because they require special working directory and/or command line options. CoD4CompileTools.exe contains propper icons to launch those applications.

If you plan on using Maya to export models and animation, please refer to the following link for maya setup instructions:

RUNNING THE TOOLS:

When running CoD4CompileTools for the first time you must click the "browse" button in the upper left corner of the "Preferences" tab and browse to the location the game is installed. Again, the default location is "C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare".
